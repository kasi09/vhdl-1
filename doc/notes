[[ synthetizer inference ]]

electronics is infered from the source and how it is written. it may be
confusing, but VHDL does not work at the wire level, and part of its work
is to determine what digital entities a construct maps to, according to
the libraries used. What has been infered at synthesis is available in the
SRP report file sections, ie. for instance (hand written incrementing counter):

-- start of fu.srp
    Related source file is "src/main.vhd".
    Found 1-bit register for signal <ovf>.
    Found 8-bit up counter for signal <x>.
    Summary:
	inferred   1 Counter(s).
	inferred   1 D-type flip-flop(s).
-- end of fu.srp

if x = (others => '1') then -- does not work
if x = (x'range => '1') then -- ok


[ functionnal simulation ]

[[ xilinx tools ]]

simulating at the functionnal level requires the vhdl files to be compiled
and run under the control of a simulator. the compiled files are package as
a static library (or at least an object collection), against which a main
object file is linked. isim is the simulator tool. fuse is the compiler tool,
relying on the gnu toolchain.

-- start of fu.prj
vhdl work ../src/counter.vhd
vhdl work ../src/tb.vhd
-- end of fu.prj

-- start of fu.sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh
fuse -intstyle ise -incremental -o counter -prj fu.prj tb
-- end of fu.sh

-- start of fu.icmd
isim force add {/tb/clk} 1 -value 0 -radix bin -time 500 ns -repeat 1 us
wave add /tb
run 300 us
-- end of fu.icmd

the generated counter program can then be run (in compilation directory):
$> ./counter -gui -tclbatch fu.icmd
