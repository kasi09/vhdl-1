ghdlex license terms
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, we're not lawyers, and we sometimes roll eyes at their language, too.
Just be so kind and follow those rules:

- If you modify the code, add your copyright and feed back your changes
  to the author(s).
  We published this for learning purposes.
- Don't remove copyrights. We will get angry, if you do.
- You can use this code commercially, but under the above conditions.
  You may NOT sell it.

There are more packages and their respective licenses involved:

- GHDL: See GPL license
- netpp: See netpp license
